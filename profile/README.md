### Hello! Welcome to Buttondown.

Buttondown is the best way for you start and grow your newsletter. 

What does that mean? 

Well, that means a lot of things. You can probably get a better sense on Buttondown's [splash page](https://buttondown.com).

If you're here, though, you're probably interested in a couple things in particular. For instance, might I recommend starting with:

- ðŸš¦Buttondown's [public roadmap](https://github.com/buttondown/roadmap)
- ðŸ’°Buttondown's [sponsorships page](https://github.com/orgs/buttondown/sponsoring), through which I've donated back thousands of dollars to the open source software that's enabled Buttondown's growth & success
- ðŸ“œButtondown's [documentation](https://github.com/buttondown/docs), which is hosted on `docs.buttondown.com`
- ðŸ’¬ Buttondown's [public discussion forum](https://github.com/buttondown/discussions/discussions) for free-form questions, ideas, or long-form chats
- ðŸ’» Buttondown's [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/buttondown/openapi), tracking changes to the externally-facing API
